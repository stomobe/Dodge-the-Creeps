# Dodge the Creeps
 Godot starter project. This is a simple game; the goal is to move the player character around to dodge the spawning enemy mobs around the screen. Your score goes up the longer you survive.

 To run, serve the file 'Dodge the creeps.html' to your browser.

 A simple way to do that is from the project root directory, start a Linux terminal and run the following:
 ```
 python3 -m http.server
```
 This will start serving the project directory to a port, usually by default localhost:8000
 Then, in your web browser, navigate to your port (ie. http://localhost:8000). Finally, select the file 'Dodge the creeps.html' to open the game.

 ## Controls:
 Movement: WASD keys or arrow keys to move the player character
 Start: click the start button or press Space key
